# py_keylogger
This Python keylogger tool is designed to monitor and record every keystroke made on a computer. It operates stealthily in the background, capturing all keyboard inputs and logging them into a file. Additionally, it periodically sends the recorded keystrokes to a specified email address, making it convenient for remote monitoring.
